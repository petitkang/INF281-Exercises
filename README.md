# INF281 Basics of Bioinformatics Sequence Analysis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/takayasaito/INF281-Lecture-Notes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/takayasaito/INF281-Lecture-Notes)

It uses Travis CI to automatically generate PDF files of the lecture notes for INF281 Basics of bioinformatics sequence analysis from Tex source files. The generated PDFs are available on the [Release page](https://github.com/takayasaito/INF281-Lecture-Notes/releases).

## Course description
### Prerequisites

Only basic mathematical background is required. We cover several mathematical concepts where needed. We assume that you know how to read and write basic computer programs, preferably in Java.

### Learning Outcomes

After completing the course you should be able to:
explain the basis of molecular biology pertaining to the course,

* make local or global pairwise alignments by dynamic programming,
* compare pairwise and multiple sequence alignment algorithms in terms of challenges and applications,
* perform sequence based searches in biological databases and subsequent statistical analyses on the search results,
* review classification performance measures in the fields of biological sequence analysis, and
* create working implementations of basic bioinformatics algorithms.
